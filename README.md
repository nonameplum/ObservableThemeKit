# ObservableThemeKit

<p align="center">
ObservableThemeKit framework allows to easily theme an application. It utilizes protocol oriented programming, property wrapper and observable pattern which allows to customize every aspect of a theme specification for your requirements.
</p>


## Features

- [x] Uses property wrappers to easlily access a defined theme
- [x] Allows to observe theme's style changes (it could be anything, it depends on you, e.g. _light_ to _dark_ transition)
- [x] You can define any style (stylesheet) that will be used in the themes

## Example

The example application is the best way to see `ObservableThemeKit` in action. Simply open the `ObservableThemeKit.xcodeproj` and run the `Example` scheme.

## Playground

The playground beyond the example application allows to quickly check the usage of the framework. Simply open `ObservableThemeKit.xcworkspace` and pick `ObservableThemeKitPlayground` from the Xcode's _Project navigator._

### CocoaPods

ObservableThemeKit is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```bash
pod 'ObservableThemeKit'
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

To integrate ObservableThemeKit into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "nonameplum/ObservableThemeKit"
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `ObservableThemeKit.framework` into your Xcode project. 

On your application targets‚Äô ‚ÄúBuild Phases‚Äù settings tab, click the ‚Äú+‚Äù icon and choose ‚ÄúNew Run Script Phase‚Äù and add the Framework path as mentioned in [Carthage Getting started Step 4, 5 and 6](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/README.md#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos)

### Swift Package Manager

To integrate using Apple's [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/), add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/nonameplum/ObservableThemeKit.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

Alternatively navigate to your Xcode project, select `Swift Packages` and click the `+` icon to search for `ObservableThemeKit`.

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate ObservableThemeKit into your project manually. Simply drag the `Sources` Folder into your Xcode project.

## Usage

The best way is to take a look at the [example app](##Example) and the [playground](##Playground).

The main concept of the framework is around the `Theme` protocol:

```swift
public protocol Theme {
    associatedtype Style
    init(stylesheet: Style)
    static var `default`: Self { get }
    static var stylesheet: Observable<Style> { get }
}
```

The idea is to provide a `Style` that will be used by themes e.g:

```swift
struct AppStylesheet {
    let accentColor: UIColor
}
```

Then you can declare the first theme like so:

```swift
struct ViewTheme: Theme {
    static let `default`: ViewController.ViewTheme = .init(stylesheet: AppStylesheet())
    static let stylesheet: Observable = Observable(AppStylesheet())
  
    let labelColor: UIColor

    init(stylesheet: AppStylesheet) {
        self.labelColor = stylesheet.accentColor
    }
}
```

The last step is to use the theme using the `ObservableTheme` _property wrapper_ which gives you freedom that the theme could be used anywhere e.g.:

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController {
		@ObservableTheme var theme: ViewTheme
}
```

The `theme` can be observed on when the `stylesheet` has changed:

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController {
		@ObservableTheme var theme: ViewTheme
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        self.$theme.observe(
            owner: self,
            handler: { (owner, _) in
                owner.setupAppearance()
            }
        )
    }
}
```

`ObservableTheme` provides `projectedValue` which is `Observable`.



It is important to mention that the `ViewTheme` implements the `Theme` protocol which means that the `struct` needs to provide

`default`, `stylesheet` `static` properties and the constructor `init` .

It is used by the `ObservableTheme` to instantiate the theme, observe the changes of the `stylesheet` and instantiate the new theme on every change and put it back via mentioned observable `projectedValue` .

Because most of the time this is not useful to have declaration of the theme like so, especially the `stylesheet` property:

```swift
struct ViewTheme: Theme {
    static let `default`: ViewController.ViewTheme = .init(stylesheet: AppStylesheet())
    static let stylesheet: Observable = Observable(AppStylesheet())
		...
}
```

If personally find useful to declare default implementation of the `stylesheet` in the `extension`:

```swift
extension Theme {
    /// Default stylesheet for the convenience
    static var stylesheet: Observable<Stylesheet> {
        return AppStylesheet.shared
    }
}
```

Having that you can then declare a theme:

```swift
struct ViewTheme: Theme {
    static let `default`: ViewController.ViewTheme = .init(stylesheet: Self.stylesheet.wrappedValue)
		...
}
```

But as you will find in the examples, there is a lot of ways how you can provide the `default` and `stylesheet`. It is up to you, it might be singleton, global variable or any other solution that will suit your needs.
